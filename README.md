![EWF](http://energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/EnergyWebnoback-1.png)

Repository for the [**Energy Web Foundation**](http://energyweb.org/) client for the Tobalaba test network.

Download this repository and compile from source or get the binaries.

## Binaries

**[Linux](https://tobalaba.slock.it/download/ewf-client-linux)**

**[Windows](https://tobalaba.slock.it/download/ewf-client-windows.exe)**

**[Mac](https://tobalaba.slock.it/download/ewf-client-mac)**

## Build dependencies

**Parity requires Rust version 1.21.0 to build**

We recommend installing Rust through [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). If you don't already have rustup, you can install it like this:

- Linux:
    ```bash
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    Parity also requires `gcc`, `g++`, `libssl-dev`/`openssl`, `libudev-dev` and `pkg-config` packages to be installed.

- OSX:
    ```bash
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    `clang` is required. It comes with Xcode command line tools or can be installed with homebrew.

- Windows:

    Make sure you have Visual Studio 2015 with C++ support installed. Next, download and run the [rustup installer](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe), start "VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt", and use the following command to install and set up the msvc toolchain:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    ```

Once you have rustup, install parity or download and build from source

----

## Build from source

```bash
# download energyweb-client code
$ git clone https://github.com/energywebfoundation/energyweb-client
$ cd energyweb-client

# build in release mode
$ cargo build --release
```

This will produce an executable in the `./target/release` subdirectory.
Note: if cargo fails to parse manifest try:

```bash
~/.cargo/bin/cargo build --release
```

----

## Start Parity

### Manually

To start Parity manually, just run

```bash
./target/release/parity --chain tobalaba
```

and Parity will begin syncing the Tobalaba blockchain.
